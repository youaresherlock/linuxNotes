#### CHAPTER 3
>In this chapter we introduce the concepts of a process and concurrent execution; 
These concepts are at the very heart of modern operating systems. A process is a 
program in execution and is the unit of work in a modern time-sharing system. Such 
a system consists of a collection of processes: Operating-system processes executing 
system code and user processes executing user code. All these processes can 
potentially execute concurrently, with the CPU (or CPUs) multiplexed among them. By 
switching the CPU between processes, theoperating system can make the computer more 
productive. We also introduce the notion of a thread (lightweight process) and 
interprocess communication (IPC). Threads are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.
在本章中，我们将介绍进程和并发执行的概念;这些概念是现代操作系统的核心。一个进程就是正在执行中
的程序，并且进程是现代分时系统的工作单元。这样的系统由一组进程组成: 操作系统进程执行用户代码
并且用户进程执行用户代码。所有这些进程都可以潜在并发执行，在它们之间多路复用CPUs.通过CPU在进
程间切换，操作系统可以让计算机更有生产力。我们也介绍了线程(轻量级线程概念)和进程间通信(IPC).
线程将在第四章中详细讨论

##### Exercises
**3.1 Describe the differences among short-term, medium-term, and long-term scheduling.**
描述短期调度、中期调度和短期调度的差异
Answer:
	a. Short-term (CPU scheduler)—selects from jobs in memory those jobs that are 
ready to execute and allocates the CPU to them.
	a. 短期调用(CPU调用程序)--从内存中的作业中选择当前的将要准备执行的作业，并且分配CPU给
它们
	b. Medium-term—used especially with time-sharing systems as an intermediate 
scheduling level. A swapping scheme is implemented to remove partially run programs 
from memory and reinstate them later to continue where they left off.
	b. 中期调用特别在分时系统作为及时调度层使用。 实现一个交换方案来从内存中删除部分执行程序，
随后恢复他们，继续接着执行
	c. Long-term (job scheduler)—determines which jobs are brought into memory for 
processing. 
The primary difference is in the frequency of their execution. The 
short-term must select a new process quite often. Long-term is used much less often 
since it handles placing jobs in the system and may wait a while for a job to finish 
before it admits another one.
	c. 长期调度程序(作业调度程序)--确定将那些作业放入内存中处理。
主要的区别在于它们的执行频率。短期调用必须经常选择新的进程.长期调度程序被使用的更少，因为它处理
在系统中放置作业，并且可能要等待作业完成一段时间才继续另一个

**3.2 Describe the actions taken by a kernel to context-switch between processes.**
内核采取一些动作以便在两个进程之间进行上下文切换，请描述一下
Answer:
	In general, the operating system must save the state of the currently running 
process and restore the state of the process scheduled to be run next. Saving the 
state of a  process typically includes the values of all the CPU registers in 
addition to memory  allocation. Context switches must also perform many 
architecture-specific operations, including flushing data and instruction caches.
	通常，操作系统必须保存当前正在运行的进程的状态，并且恢复计划下一步运行的进程的状态。
保存a进程的状态通常包括CPU寄存器的值，以及牛才能分配。上下文交换必须也执行许多特定于结构的
操作，包括刷新数据和指令缓存

**3.3 大家随便画画,试试命令**

**3.4 Explain the role of the init process on UNIX and Linux systems in regards to 
process termination.**
针对Unix和Linux系统的init进程在进程终止方面的作用，请解释一下
Answer:
	When a process is terminated, it briefly moves to the zombie state and remains
in that state until the parent invokes a call to wait(). When this occurs, the 
process id as well as entry in the process table are both released. However, if a 
parent does not invoke wait(), the child process remains a zombie as long as the 
parent remains alive. Once the parent process terminates, the init process becomes 
the new parent of the zombie. Periodically, the init process calls wait() which 
ultimately releases the pid and entry in the process table of the zombie process.
	当进程终止时，它会短暂的移动到僵尸状态，并保持该状态(成为僵尸进程),直到父进程调用
wait()方法。当调用后，僵尸进程的id和进程表中的条目都将被释放.


**3.5 Including the initial parent process, how many processes are created by the
program shown in Figure 3.32?**
包括初始的父进程，总共下面创建了多少个进程
Answer:
	16 processes are created. The program online includes printf() statements to\
better understand how many processes have been created.
	创建了16个进程，该程序可以加入printf()语句来更好说明创建了几个进程
```c {.line-numbers}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() 
{
	int i;
	for(i = 0; i < 4; i++)
		fork();
	return 0;
}
```
